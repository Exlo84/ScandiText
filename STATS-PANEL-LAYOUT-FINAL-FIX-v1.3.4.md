# Stats Panel Layout Fix - v1.3.4

## Issue Resolution
Successfully fixed the "Tekststatistikk" panel positioning issue that was preventing it from appearing on the right side of the main content area.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by:
1. **HTML Structure Error**: An extra `</div>` tag was prematurely closing the `editor-section`, which broke the CSS grid layout
2. **CSS Specificity Issues**: Mobile-specific CSS rules were interfering with desktop layout

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed HTML Structure**: Removed the extra `</div>` tag that was breaking the grid layout in `index.html`
2. **Enhanced CSS Grid Rules**: Added high-specificity CSS rules to ensure proper grid layout on desktop
3. **Improved Media Query Handling**: Better separation between mobile and desktop styles

## Changes Made

### HTML Changes
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Change**: Removed extra `</div>` tag after `.tool-group` that was breaking the grid structure
- **Result**: `stats-panel` is now properly positioned as a sibling to `editor-section` within `main-content`

### CSS Changes
- **File**: `css/main.css`
- **Added**: High-specificity CSS rules using `body .container .main-content` selector
- **Enhanced**: Media queries with `@media screen and (min-width: 769px)` for better desktop targeting
- **Improved**: Grid layout with proper `grid-template-areas: "editor stats"`

## Layout Structure (Fixed)
```
main-content (CSS Grid)
├── editor-section (grid-area: editor)
└── stats-panel (grid-area: stats)
```

## Visual Result
- ✅ "Tekststatistikk" panel now appears on the right side of main content
- ✅ Proper responsive behavior maintained for mobile devices
- ✅ Clean grid layout with appropriate spacing
- ✅ Ready for potential Google Ads integration in empty space areas

## Testing
- ✅ Desktop layout: Stats panel correctly positioned on right
- ✅ Mobile layout: Stats panel maintains slide-out functionality
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility maintained
- ✅ Responsive design preserved

## Next Steps
- Consider adding Google Ads integration in available space areas
- Monitor layout stability across different screen sizes
- Potential future enhancements to ad placement areas
