# SECURITY FIX - API Key Exposure

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem
The previous fix accidentally embedded the Google Translate API key directly in the HTML file, which exposed it publicly and triggered GitHub secret detection.

### Solution Applied ✅
- **REMOVED** embedded API key from index.html
- **SECURED** configuration loading to only use config.js from server
- **IMPROVED** error messages to guide proper deployment
- **MAINTAINED** the event handler fix for translation functionality

## 🔐 Secure Deployment Process

### For Local Development:
1. Keep API key in `.env` file (already gitignored)
2. Use `config.js` generated from `.env` for local testing
3. Never commit `config.js` to git

### For Production Deployment:
1. Upload `config.js` separately to server (not via git)
2. Ensure `config.js` is accessible at `https://nordisk.exlo.no/config.js`
3. Translation will work when config.js is properly uploaded

### Files Modified (Security Fix):
- `index.html` - Removed embedded API key, kept secure loading
- `js/googleTranslate.js` - Added better error messaging
- `js/envLoader.js` - Improved fallback handling without exposing keys
- `deploy.sh` - Added security warnings and instructions

## 🎯 Current Status
- ✅ **Security**: No API keys exposed in public code
- ✅ **Functionality**: Translation event handler fixed
- ✅ **Deployment**: Clear instructions for secure config upload
- ✅ **Icons**: All 404 errors resolved

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Upload the secure version of index.html
2. Upload config.js separately to server
3. Test translation functionality

**The translation will work properly once config.js is uploaded to the server, without compromising security.**
